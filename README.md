# Library Template

So you want to deploy a python package that will ultimately land in the DSF? You've come to the right place!

This template gives you all the files needed to ensure your 🐍 Python model is packaged 📦 and gets deployed to Artifactory then DSF. 🚀

👉 Maybe you don't need Python and have a Pure SQL or BQML pipeline? Checkout our [sql-batch-job-template](https://github.com/mailchimp/sql-batch-job-template/blob/main/README.md) instead.

👉 Maybe you want to create a Streamlit demo? Checkout our [streamlit-template
](https://github.com/mailchimp/datascience-template-streamlit) instead.
